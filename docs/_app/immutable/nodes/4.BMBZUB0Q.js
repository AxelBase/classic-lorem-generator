In the 1500s, an unknown printer scrambled sections of this work to create a type specimen book. The result? A scrambled but natural-looking Latin text that has been used for over 500 years.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why the Classic Version Still Wins</h2> <p>Modern “lorem ipsum” generators often create fake words or repetitive patterns. But the original text has something they don’t: <strong>authentic word length distribution, sentence rhythm, and punctuation flow</strong> — exactly like real prose.</p> <p>This is why professional designers and typographers prefer the classic version. It doesn’t distract with readable English, yet it feels natural. Letters like “h”, “t”, and “e” appear in realistic proportions. Ascenders and descenders balance perfectly. Your layout looks real from the very first mockup.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">The First Paragraph Tradition</h2> <p>You’ve probably noticed: nearly every classic generator starts with the same famous paragraph. That’s not an accident — it’s tradition. This tool honors that by offering the “Start with real first paragraph” option (enabled by default).</p> <p>When you need true visual accuracy, there’s no substitute for the original.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Fun Fact</h2> <p>The phrase “Lorem Ipsum” itself doesn’t appear in Cicero’s work — it’s a corruption of “dolorem ipsum” (“pain itself”) caused by the printer cutting off the beginning and end of lines.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Next time you use placeholder text, remember: you’re not just filling space — you’re using a 2,000-year-old piece of design history.</p></article> <div class="text-center mt-5"><a class="btn btn-outline-primary">← Back to Blog</a></div></div>');function D(d){var e=q();T("1tq17n3",g=>{var i=k(),y=m(v(i),6);c(8),p(()=>a(y,"content",`${s??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),b(()=>{w.title="The History of Lorem Ipsum: From Cicero to Modern Design | AxelBase Blog"}),l(g,i)});var t=r(e),u=r(t);c(4),o(t);var n=m(t,4),f=r(n);o(n),o(e),p(()=>{a(u,"href",`${s??""}/blog`),a(f,"href",`${s??""}/blog`)}),l(d,e)}export{D as component,M as universal};
